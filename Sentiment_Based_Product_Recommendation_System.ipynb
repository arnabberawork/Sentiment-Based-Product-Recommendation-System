        "### Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The e-commerce industry has revolutionized the way people shop, with customers placing orders directly from websites rather than relying on physical stores. Companies like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra have set high standards in this space by offering personalized shopping experiences through advanced recommendation systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ebuss, a growing e-commerce company, operates across various categories, including household essentials, books, personal care, medicines, beauty products, appliances, kitchenware, and healthcare products. To compete with established leaders and capture a larger market share, Ebuss seeks to enhance its recommendation system by integrating sentiment analysis into the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a senior Machine Learning Engineer, our task is to develop and deploy a **Sentiment-Based Product Recommendation System** that analyzes customer reviews and ratings to provide personalized and accurate recommendations, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and engagement.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Project Objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Derive customer sentiments from reviews to enrich the recommendation logic.\n",
        "2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Develop and assess both **User-Based** and **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** models.\n",
        "3. **Hybrid Integration**: Merge collaborative filtering with sentiment insights for improved recommendations.\n",
        "4. **Deployment**: Deliver a production-ready web application hosted on the cloud for real-time usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Detailed Workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **1. Data Exploration and Analysis**\n",
        "- Import and investigate datasets containing user ratings, reviews, and product metadata.\n",
        "- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, spot anomalies, and understand data distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Data Cleaning**\n",
        "- Eliminate duplicates, address missing data, and remove irrelevant entries.\n",
        "- Unify data formats (e.g., product IDs, timestamps).\n",
        "- Clean and standardize text fields for consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. Text Preprocessing**\n",
        "- Prepare textual reviews for sentiment modeling through:\n",
        "  - Lowercasing, punctuation and stopword removal.\n",
        "  - Tokenization and lemmatization of text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **4. Feature Engineering**\n",
        "- Convert processed text into numerical representations using:\n",
        "  - Techniques like **TF-IDF**, **Bag-of-Words**, or **Word Embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **5. Sentiment Classification**\n",
        "- Train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or deep learning models to classify review sentiments.\n",
        "- Evaluate using metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **6. Recommendation Engine Development**\n",
        "- Implement two collaborative filtering approaches:\n",
        "  - **User-Based Filtering**: Recommend products liked by similar users.\n",
        "  - **Item-Based Filtering**: Suggest products similar to those previously liked.\n",
        "- Compare both models using performance indicators like **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **7. Sentiment-Augmented Recommendations**\n",
        "- Integrate sentiment predictions to refine recommendations:\n",
        "  - Favor items with higher positive sentiment scores.\n",
        "  - Adjust the ranking of recommended items based on both sentiment and similarity scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **8. System Evaluation**\n",
        "- Measure how well the combined model aligns with real user preferences.\n",
        "- Analyze the improvement in recommendation quality after sentiment integration.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **9. Flask Web Application**\n",
        "- Develop a Flask-based web interface:\n",
        "  - Set up API routes for generating recommendations.\n",
        "  - Design a clean user interface for input and output interaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Final Deliverables\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Trained Machine Learning Models** for sentiment and recommendations.\n",
        "2. **Serialized Model Artifacts** (Pickle files) for efficient deployment.\n",
        "3. **Flask-Based Web Application** to serve recommendations.\n",
        "4. **Live Deployment** on DigitalOcean, accessible to users via a web interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expected Outcome\n",
        "\n",
        "The end result will be a robust and intelligent recommendation system tailored to user sentiments, delivering precise, engaging, and user-centric suggestions. This will elevate the customer experience on Ebuss and position the company more competitively within the digital marketplace."

It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensatio...   \n",

It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensatio...   \n",

It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensatio...   \n",

I don't know why Clear is not taking the feedback from its consumers - over 50 comments from people who have taken the time to write to you about a product they once loved. I know the average rating was above 4.8 stars... now it is at 2.9. Clear- PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS! We hate this product and want the original back. Until then...

I don't know why Clear is not taking the feedback from its consumers - over 50 comments from people who have taken the time to write to you about a product they once loved. I know the average rating was above 4.8 stars... now it is at 2.9. Clear- PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS! We hate this product and want the original back. Until then...

        " - After testing both User-User and Item-Item Collaborative Filtering methods, the User-User Collaborative Filtering emerged as the superior approach due to its lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This demonstrates that User-User filtering more effectively captures user preferences, resulting in better personalized recommendations.\n",
        " - The system also integrates sentiment analysis to prioritize products with positive reviews, enhancing the relevance and quality of the recommendations. The complete recommendation system is deployed using a Flask app hosted on DigitalOcean, ensuring it is reliable and easily accessible.\n",
        " - By focusing on User-User Collaborative Filtering, the model provides more accurate, sentiment-aware, and user-focused recommendations, making it the best fit for this use case."
